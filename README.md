# Barcelona-Data-Analysis
This repository contains some public Data about the city Barcelona. The goal was to investigate the data and try to gain interesting insights by using different Statistical Methods such as Correlation Tests, Permutation Tests and checking for influential other variables. The code is written in R.
I have analyzed Unemployment rates and possible factors, such as the number/ share of young people within a district. Further I have checked if the number of immigrants influences the unemployment rate, as well as how and if summer tourism influences the unemployment rate. But of course when analyzing data one has to remove all influential 3rd variables which may be a cofounding factor.
The higher life expectancy of women could also easily be shown. 

Please have a look at the PDF Output file of the R-Markdown file.
